# Mock√≠mon

This is meant to be a simple resource that can be used to teach about how to use an API.

### Why use this instead of the PokeAPI?

Great question! There are a few reasons:

1. The PokeAPI is a great resource, but it is also a very large resource. It can be a bit overwhelming to use for beginners.
2. If you are worried about trademark issues, this is a great alternative.
